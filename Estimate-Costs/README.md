The monthly cost is between $8,000-10,000 using the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator

**[Modify the infrastructure to reduce the monthly cost](https://github.com/amansoni172/AWS-Design-for-Performance-and-Scalability/blob/master/Estimate-Costs/Reduced_Cost_Estimate.csv "Modify the infrastructure to reduce the monthly cost")**

- The infrastructure includes all required services to run properly
- The monthly cost is $6,500 or below using the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator
